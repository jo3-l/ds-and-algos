# Data structures & algorithms

> A bunch of data structures and algorithms implemented in C.

Not supposed to be efficient or anything, just trying to learn new data structures & algorithms in addition to C.

## List

Not many at the moment, but more will be added soon.

**Data structures**

-   [Array list / dynamic array](./src/data_structures/arraylist)
-   [Doubly linked list](./src/data_structures/doubly_linked_list)
-   [Singly linked list](./src/data_structures/singly_linked_list)

**Algorithms**

None at the moment :(
